Agent AI need 4 things:
	A sensor or input system
	A working memory
	A reasoning/analysis core
	An action/output system

Sensing the world:
	What is sensed depends on the game
	Sensing is usually the slowest part of the game
	Pathfinding is expensive!

	For InBo:
	I dont think we will need to do much in the way of sensing.
		
		Can we attack?
		Can we see a player?
		What's my health?
		
		For grouund enemies:
			Melee:
				No extra vars?
			Ranged:
				Are we within range?
		Flying Enemies:
			Melee:
				Probably wont exist
			Ranged: 
				See above

Ai Technologies:
	
	FSM:
		A set of states that represent the scenarios or configurations that AI can be immersed in
		A set of transitions that are conditions that connect two states in a directed way
